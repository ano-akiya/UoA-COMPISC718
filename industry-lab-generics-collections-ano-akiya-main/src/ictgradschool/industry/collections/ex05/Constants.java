            "By 1985 the global Internet began to penetrate Europe and the Domain Name System (which the Uniform Resource Locator is built upon) came into being. " +
            "In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like " +
            "system at CERN.[7]\n\nIn March 1989 Tim Berners-Lee issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called \"Mesh\" that referenced ENQUIRE, " +
            "a database and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term \"web\" and described a more elaborate information management system based " +
            "on links embedded in readable text: \"Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which " +
            "they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse.\n Such a system, he explained, could be referred to " +
            "using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, " +
            "why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to propose the term " +
            "hypermedia.[8]\n\nWith help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 " +
            "to build a \"Hypertext project\" called \"WorldWideWeb\" (one word) as a \"web\" of \"hypertext documents\" to be viewed by \"browsers\" using a " +
            "clientâ€“server architecture.[9] At this point HTML and HTTP had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month " +
            "from completing its first successful test.\n\nThis proposal estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six " +
            "months to achieve \"the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal\" as well as \"the automatic notification " +
            "of a reader when new material of interest to him/her has become available.\" While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship of web content " +
            "took longer to mature, with the wiki concept, WebDAV, blogs, Web 2.0 and RSS/Atom.[10]";
